# ⏳ Time Flow

**Time Flow** is a widget-based productivity app that helps you **visualize your time** directly on your home screen. It shows how much of your **day, week, month, and year** has passed using elegant progress bars and percentage displays — so you stay mindful and stop wasting time.

> See the time slipping away — and make every moment count.

## 🧠 Why Time Flow?

We often lose track of time. Time Flow makes time **visible** so you can:

- Refocus your energy
- Beat procrastination
- Work with intention

It displays real-time progress for:
- 🕐 **Today**
- 📅 **This Week**
- 📆 **This Month**
- 📈 **This Year**
